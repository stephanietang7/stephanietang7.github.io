                                    BTS just became the first K-pop band to address the United Nations.

                                    As reported last week, the groundbreaking moment is all part of the group's partnership with UNICEF's new global initiative, Generation Unlimited, which launched on Monday and is aimed at encouraging young people. In their seven-minute speech on Monday, delivered in English by RM, BTS talked all about what it takes to practice self-love and acceptance.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    RM began by thanking the BTS ARMY for being a major part of their previous campaign, the Love Myself movement that was part of UNICEF's #ENDviolence campaign. "We truly have the best fans in the world," he said.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He then kicked off his speech by talking about his childhood in Ilsan, a city near the South Korean capital of Seoul. "I used to imagine that I was a superhero who could save the world," he said. "In an intro to one of our early albums, there's a line that says, 'My heart stopped when I was maybe nine or ten.' Looking back, I think that's when I began to worry about what other people thought of me, and started seeing myself through their eyes. I stopped looking up at the night skies, the stars, I stopped daydreaming. Instead, I just tried to jam myself into the molds that other people made. Soon, I began to shut out my own voice and started to listen to the voices of others."

                                   “Parasite” made Academy Award history on Sunday night by becoming the first foreign-language movie to win best picture. Its victory was a testament to the near universal praise for the film and for Bong, who became a beloved figure as he enjoyed all the trappings of the awards season.

                                    When she put together an outfit based on her favorite GOT7 album, 15-year-old Hayeon didn’t mean to start a trend — but she has since inspired K-pop fans around the world to recreate the aesthetics of their favorite albums in outfit form. The trend was a way to bring fans together during a time of insularity.

                                    In the wake of George Floyd's killing and amid Black Lives Matter protests, there's been a paradigm shift in the perception of K-pop stans online. While locals (non-stans) have typically had an adversarial relationship with K-pop fandom in the past, recent events have shaken that relationship up.
